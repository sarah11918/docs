In this tutorial, you will build a fully-functioning Astro blog website, step-by-step, taking you from zero to full launch! ðŸš€

Along the way, you will see core Astro concepts like **partial hydration**, **component-based composition** and **file routing** in action. 

You'll build with Astro using established web development practices such as **refactoring**, **semantic HTML tags**, and **mobile-first, responsive design**. 

And you will also learn how to:
- set up your development environnment and start a new project
- create and edit pages for your website
- build with Astro components
- use Astro's run-time API
- add interativity to your site


:::note
If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre-built Astro site, you can visit https://astro.new and choose a starter template to open and edit in a in an online editor.

:::tip
You can also visit https://astro.build/play to see how Astro component-based composition works in a single page.

## Project: Build a blog

The "My Learning Astro Blog" that you will build has many of the features you would expect in a developer blog: a Home page, an About page, and a Blog Index page linking to individual blog posts. The finished blog will be deployed to the web, and can even be used as a personal website once you have completed this tutorial!
